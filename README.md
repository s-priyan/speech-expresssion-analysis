# Sentiment Analysis on Call Center Audio Recordings
This solution outlines an automated pipeline for analyzing call center audio recordings to assess sentiment and provide actionable insights. The workflow integrates multiple systems and APIs to process, analyze, and report on the sentiment of calls efficiently.

## Workflow Overview:
### Audio Data Collection (MP4 Drop):
Call center conversations are recorded and stored as MP4 files.
These recordings are automatically dropped into a designated folder for processing.
Corresponding call logs, including client and case IDs, are also logged for reference.

### Data Processing:
The MP4 files are pulled from the storage folder into the sentiment analysis system.
This system likely includes audio preprocessing steps (e.g., speech-to-text conversion) and applies sentiment analysis models to determine the emotional tone of the conversations.
Results Distribution:

### Dashboard Publishing:
The analyzed results, including sentiment scores and trends, are published to a dashboard for visualization and further interpretation by call center managers or supervisors.

### Email Alerts for Negative Outcomes:
If negative sentiments or critical issues are detected, automated email alerts are sent to the relevant stakeholders, enabling prompt intervention.

### API Integration (Hoowla API):
The processed data, including sentiment scores and call metadata, is pushed to external systems via the Hoowla API for integration with case management tools or customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

### End-User Interaction:
Call center managers or agents can access the dashboard for insights and receive email alerts for immediate actions, ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
